GAME LOGIC, JS FILE IS "TAKEN" FROM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iscLNDuFLHU&t=1509s:
WHEN I SAID TAKEN I MEAN THAT I WATCH VIDEO AND WRITE MY CODE SIDE BY SIDE WITH HIM, (I ADD SOME CHANGES IN CODE)
GIVEN CODE FROM DOMEN, ISN'T CLEAR TO ME SO I WRITE THIS JS IMPLEMENTATION;
ALL OTHER WORK SUCH CSS STYLE, HTML CODE, AND SOME FUNCTIONS ARE WRITTEN ONLY BY ME!!!

P.S. (After 3 years from coding this)

--> This is basic aplication from game Minesweeper, it's seminar work for students in first year (Computer Science).
